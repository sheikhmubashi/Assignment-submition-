    "\n",
    "1: It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes \n",

    "\n",
    "2: Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. \n",
    "    More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3: It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues \n",
    "    without a need to make large-scale changes\n",
    "    \n",
    "4: Reuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, \n",
    "    and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5: It provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and \n",
    "    modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6: Better Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, \n",
    "    help her get more work done; finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain. \n",
    "    OOP programmers take new and existing software objects and \"stitch\" them together to make new programs. \n",
    "    Because object libraries contain many useful functions, software developers don't have to reinvent the \n",
    "    wheel as often; more of their time goes into making the new program."
